#### A first person sandbox experience

The goal of this project is to showcase the possibilities you can do with 3d in the browser, specifically focused on first-person gameplay. It's a good starting point if you are looking to create your own first-person game or similar. It can be served as a simple game engine or alternatively a library of re-usable first-person related components.
