fps (IN DEVELOPMENT)
====================

#### A first person sandbox experience

The goal of this project is to showcase the possibilities you can do with 3d in the browser, specifically focused on first-person gameplay. It's a good starting point if you are looking to create your own first-person game or similar. It can be served as a simple game engine or alternatively a library of re-usable first-person related components.

### Why Three.js & React?

Three.js is built on top of WebGL that makes it easier to create 3d in the web. Using React in conjunction with three.js has several advantages: separation between state and view, modularity, scalability to name a few.

Note that using three.js with React does not have any limitations whatsoever, you can still incorporate scripts from this project to your own project even if you are not using React.
