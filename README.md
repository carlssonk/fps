fps (IN DEVELOPMENT)
====================

#### A first person sandbox experience

The goal of this project is to showcase the possibilities you can do with 3d in the browser, specifically focused on first-person gameplay. It's a good starting point if you are looking to create your own first-person game or similar. It can be served as a simple game engine or alternatively a library of re-usable first-person related components.

### Why Three.js & React?

Three.js is built on top of WebGL that makes it easier to create 3d in the web. Using React in conjunction with three.js has several advantages: separation between state and view, modularity, scalability to name a few.

Note that using three.js with React does not have any limitations other that you are coding in a higher level so to speak (which can make things harder to debug). Components participate in a unified renderloop outside of React and even outperforms three.js in scale due to Reacts scheduling abilities.
